# Scientific Python Visualizations

This repository contains a collection of scientific Python scripts and animations. The codes are designed to visualize and demonstrate fundamental concepts in physics, mathematics, chemistry, quantum mechanics etc. Each script is self-contained and produces an interactive or animated visualization.

## Contents

- **mandelbrot-zoom**  
  Animated zoom into the Mandelbrot fractal set, visualizing complex dynamics and self-similarity.

- **electric_field.py**  
  Animated electric field vectors for moving point charges, including color-coded field direction and dynamic charge motion.

- **polarized_light.py**  
  Visualization of polarized light, showing the transition from elliptical to linear polarization through a polarizing filter.

## Features

- All scripts use `matplotlib` for high-quality 2D/3D plotting and animation.
- Animations are interactive and visually engaging, suitable for educational purposes.
- The code is modular and well-commented for easy understanding and modification.
- Most visualizations include physical parameters that can be easily adjusted.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy the desired script.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x and the required packages:
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
3. Run any script with:
   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```
   (e.g., `python mandelbrot-zoom.py`)
