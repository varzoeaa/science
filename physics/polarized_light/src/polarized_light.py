# --- Scientific background ---
# This animation helps you see what happens to light as it passes through a polarizing filter.
# Light is an electromagnetic wave, and its electric field can wiggle in different directions.
# At first, the light in the animation is elliptically polarized: its electric field moves in both the x and y directions, tracing out an ellipse as it travels forward.
# Halfway through, a polarizer appears (the white plane at y=0). This filter only lets the x-direction through, blocking the y-direction.
# After passing through the polarizer, the light is linearly polarized: now the electric field only wiggles along the x-axis.
# This is a key idea in optics, and itâ€™s used in everyday things like sunglasses, LCD screens, and cameras.
