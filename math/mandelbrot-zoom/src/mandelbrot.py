# --- Scientific background ---
# The Mandelbrot set is a fascinating and iconic fractal that lives in the complex plane.
# To determine if a point c belongs to the Mandelbrot set, we start with z = 0 and repeatedly apply the rule z = z^2 + c.
# If this sequence stays bounded (meaning |z| never grows beyond 2, no matter how many times we iterate), then c is part of the Mandelbrot set.
# If the sequence escapes (|z| becomes greater than 2), c is not in the set.
# When visualizing, we color each point based on how quickly the sequence escapesâ€”this reveals the intricate, infinitely detailed boundary of the Mandelbrot set.
